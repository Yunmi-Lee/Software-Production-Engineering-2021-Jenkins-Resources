A repository containing material covered in lab session as well as helpful resources. You can find the slides covered in class [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hTTM1Xei3CwP-2G8qwAlgdDIAVhDY3YuLQsAH3-_oM8/edit?usp=sharing).

## System Requirements install Jenkins
 - Atleast 4 GB RAM
 - Make sure nothing else is running on port 8080 (default port of Jenkins) or open jenkins in a different port.
 - If you doing a native installation, make sure Java is installed. 
 - If you use MacOS make sure [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed.
 - If you are installing on docker, make sure you have docker up and running.
 
 ## Installing Jenkins
 
 There are plenty of resources online that tell you how to install jenkins but here are are a few guides that I have tried and tested. I also recommend you to read the articles rather than copy pasting the commands blindly.
