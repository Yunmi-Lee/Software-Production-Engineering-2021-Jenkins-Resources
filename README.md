A repository containing material covered in lab session on Jenkins for the SPE course at IIIT-B. 

## How to use this repository ?

You can find the slides covered in class [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hTTM1Xei3CwP-2G8qwAlgdDIAVhDY3YuLQsAH3-_oM8/edit?usp=sharing). Follow along with the slides. The slides have links to specific parts of this repository like installing jenkins, setting up jenkins etc which should help you to get started with jenkins. 

## System Requirements install Jenkins
 - Atleast 4 GB RAM
 - Make sure nothing else is running on port 8080 (default port of Jenkins) or open jenkins in a different port.
 - If you doing a native installation, make sure Java is installed. 
 - If you use MacOS make sure [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed.
 - If you are installing on docker, make sure you have docker up and running.
 
 ## Installing Jenkins
 
There are plenty of resources online that tell you how to install jenkins but here are are a few guides that I have tried and tested. I also recommend you to read the articles rather than copy pasting the commands blindly.
 
 ### Ubuntu
 
Install Java8 and then follow [Digital Ocean's guide to installing jenkins on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-jenkins-on-ubuntu-18-04)
 
 ### MacOS

Install Java8 then follow Option1 in [How to install and configure jenkins on mac os](https://coralogix.com/log-analytics-blog/how-to-install-and-configure-jenkins-on-the-mac-os/)
 
 ### Docker
 
Install docker and then follow Option2 in [How to install and configure jenkins on mac os](https://coralogix.com/log-analytics-blog/how-to-install-and-configure-jenkins-on-the-mac-os/)

## Post-installation setup.
